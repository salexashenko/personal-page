        <p>Over the years, I have written many things, some good, some bad, some horribly embarassing.</p>
        <p>I currently write on <a href="https://sergey.substack.com">Substack</a>. Some good posts include:</p>

        <p>I once wrote a book on dendritic computation called Cortical Circuitry. If you're interested in how human
            brains work - I self-recommend it. You can download the book <a
                href="/static/CorticalCircuitry.pdf">here</a>. Amazon is out of hard copies but I have a few left - if
            you'd like one, shoot me an email.</p>
